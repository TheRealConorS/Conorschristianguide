You might been wondering for a while.If god created us all why dont we all speak the same language?

In a story in the bible in the old testament called "The tower of bable" located in genesis 11:1-31 it explains on how people tried to create a tower to reach the heavens above and make a name for the small city they have made.

God looked came down to earth seeing the impossible task they were trying to achieve that would get them killed the lord scattered all there languages so they would be disorginized.He also scattered them all over the world.

Some sentences from that chapter:
  Genesis 11:7 "Come, let us go down and confuse their language,so they will not understand each other"
  Genesis 11:8 "So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth"
