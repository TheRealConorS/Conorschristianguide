 If you ever wonder if humans and dinosaures co-existe well stop windering as the bible provides the awnser for your question

 
Job 40:15-24 God describes to job(who lived after the flood) a great beast that he was familier with. This great animal called "behemoth" is described as "The chief of the ways of god",perhaps the biggst land animal god has created.Impressively,he moved his tail like a cedar tree "This describes the size and the tail of a brachiosaurus"

 
You might be wondering what other theories are out there.Well the evolutionists explains the mysterious extinction of dinosaurs

 
"Dinosaures starved to death; dies from overheating;they were poisened;mass suicide;shrinking brain;changes in combostion in ait"

 
Now Dinosaures did in fact go extinct and the bible doesent exactly say how but here are some theories *The after-flood world was very different

 
(1) Competition for food that was no longer in abundunce (2) man killing dinosaures for food or fun (3) destruction of habitates

 
Now there are still more questions thou like, How long did dinosaures stick around?, What dinosaures mad it the longes

 
Well that was my rant on dinosaurces and the bible might do one on aliens and egypt next
