You have to run the command "cargo run" twice



Basically this is kinda a search index for the bible say if you want to see metions of suicide or dinosaurs you search it up in the search bar :)
The search bar is literal so you have to get the word 100% spelled correct

Error in program when compiling at 7:34pm 12/22/22

The error was due to a fontconfig not being found which is needed for a library in the project

To fix said error you run the following command:

    sudo apt-get install libfontconfig libfontconfig1-dev
